## Self-Evaluation:

how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment:

I'd give myself a 19/20 for this assignment. I believe I covered all the bases for the assignment and passed test cases.

## Self-Reflection:
Prior to this module I didn't know anything regarding the canvas API or drawing shapes. After completing this assignment, I came to the realization that using canvas to create shapes can be very tedious. 

### How long it took me to finish this?
I worked on this over the course of 2 days and it's easily the longest time I have spent on an assignment. One of the things that really tripped me up was updating the placeholder word from an underscord to the correct letter if it was guessed. I was finally able to overcome that issue with a nested for loop.
